# Cloud Native Databases Workshop

This repository will contain the materials and instructions for the Cloud Native Databases Workshop, proposed to several conferences in 2019.  If accepted, the repositiory will be populated with a full set of setup instructions and software installation 2 weeks prior to each conference where it is presented.

For an example of the required setup, please see [last year's pgKubernetes tutorial](https://github.com/jberkus/pgKubernetesTutorial).  The setup for this tutorial will be fairly similar to that one.
